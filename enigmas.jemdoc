I enjoy trying to solve enigmas. If you too, here is a small selection of my favourite. 
Please don't hesitate to drop me an email 
if you want 
to share with me one of your own or
if you want to discuss about a solution. 

*Tiling *
\n

Using 2x1 dominoes, is it possible to tile a 8x8 board which has its top left and bottom right pieces missing ? 
~~~

*Filling a hypercube*
\n
Is it possible to fill a 6x6x6 cube using only 4x1x1 sticks ? 

*The cat and the duck*
\n
A duck is enjoying a nice swim in the center of a circular pond when a hydrophobic cat appears.
The cat can move itself on land 4 times faster than the duck can in the water, but cannot swim. 
Whatever the cat's strategy, is it possible for the duck to reach dry land without the cat 
eating him when he reaches it ? 

*The boat and the rock*
\n
You are on a fishing boat in the middle of a lake.  You throw a rock which you had in your pocket 
in the water. Will the level of the water rise, decrease or stay the same ?

*Ancient chronometer*
\n
You have a lighter as well as two ropes which burn in 
an hour if you light them up. However they do not burn at the same speed and
do not burn linearly, meaning that it does not necessarily take 
30 minutes for half of a rope to burn. How can you measure 45 minutes using these two ropes ?
